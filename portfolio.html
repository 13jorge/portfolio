<h3>The Spartan Wonderland, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
<p>My concept for this project was to take San Jose State to another world. So I decided to makes things that were not really real or things that usually are not together. That where the volcano and water come into place, as well as the big foxes.</p>

<h3>The Hidden Black Square, Net Art, 2019</h3>
<p>I wanted to create a game that was in a way hard but at the same time colorful. I came up with this concept because looking for something is hard especially when it blends in with the background. This a challenging game that but can help with memory coordination. Can you Find the Black Square?</p>
