    <h4> Art is a form where you can either express a certain thing or for entertainment purposes and for me as an artist I want my work to entertain people and find some sort of inspiration. Throughout my years of studying art, glitch art has really resonated with me. I want to create glitch work that will eventually become interactive by using coding methods. I mainly like to work with coding, illustrator, and photoshop to create my interactive glitch work. Since technology is rapidly advancing coding is the best method for me as an artist because there will be new technology where I will be able to use to create my work.</h4>

<h4> How my process usually begins is I like to look at picture or go outside and start sketching after I have found inspiration from all my sketches I will begin designing. I create many different types of design until I feel like I have an interesting collection, after I will begin glitching them. After I am done with that process I will put all the images together and decide what kind of interactivity I want to do based on how the images look and begin coding. So the subject matter can change with each project I do because each glitch is different. The glitch can have a different meaning or inspiration to different person and that is my goal for someone to feel inspired by the glitch or interactivity. </h4>
