    <h4> As a digital media artist, I have a vast knowledge in many types of mediums in the digital realm. But the main medium I like to work with is web design specifically combing web design with glitch art. My style of work is close to what abstract artist would do but in this instance in web design. I prefer to make work that looks interesting and has no meaning to it, something that will catch someone attention or keep them looking through the website. As I have started leaning more about web design, I have also gotten fascinated in interactive art through websites. Growing up I played many videos games and because of this it has made me want to make work where people can interact with my work. Not specifically games but web art that will get someone hooked to explore the website. In video games there is something called an “Easter Egg” where player look around to uncover secrets, I want to get have this same felling but through a website in the future. Web art is perfect for this because as technologies advance so does the medium and new art will come out of it. For the mean time glitching work in my eyes has been one of the ways where it can catch someone eyes and be interested in the work. The reason for that because even when I glitch something you can see the residues of the old image so people will try to figure out what the image was before it was glitched. I want my art to abstract and to get people to interact with it. As we move forward with technology many artworks are going to be more accessible and I want my art to be like that from the start.
