    <h4> When I do art I want my art to be interacted with, I want the viewer to have a choice on how my art will be interacted. My art is based upon user interaction, the way I get to do that is with coding or as itâ€™s known Net/Code art. The reason I chose this medium is because coding gives me an option to have an infinite amount of user interacting with my art. Also there will always be new types of technology that comes out in the future and I can use those and implement them into my work to do different types of interaction. Even though my main medium is coding I also work with photoshop and I do glitch art. I want to eventually implement glitch art with Net/Code Art because it will appeal with the audience. What I mean by that is as we create new tech eventually glitches or lag will come with that technology. What I want to do is use those glitches into my work but make it interactive and have a user interface where the user can create there own glitch. I want to expand my work with the new technology into something that makes my audience and me as the artist come together as a community. As an artist I want to have interactivity not just from my work but from the artist to the viewer and with coding I think it is the best way to do that. I got this inspiration form twitch steamers that have community that they interact with everyday. For them it is streaming games and talking to a live chat but for me it will be based upon my work on a website. I want to make art that is user interaction and visibly appealing, if my work ends up inspiring someone and creates communities that is even better because I will know they had the experience of interacting with my work.</h4>
